    <description>If you like halowars1 and want to play vs ai but cant due to the ai being terrible and want a new fresh take on the game's balance than this is the best mod out there for that. Every unit has been altered to fit the balance of this mod and make the ai much more difficult and most importantly uncheeseable. Play by yourself or with friends online against a new level of bots that will make you really need to play halowars1 at its fullest to defeat. This mod is meant for people looking for a fun challenge. One that doesn't cheat too hard like automatic ai difficulty does, but instead makes the bots more intelligent and consistent. Plenty of bug fixes that the base game had in it and many more viable strategies than the base game. Every unit should feel usable and effective as long as the situation calls for it. I really hope you enjoy as much as me and my friends have.</description>

    <description>Ever wanted to play Halo Wars but thought "man this game doesn't really fit the Halloween spirit"? While I'm sure you haven't, this mod has come to exist anyway because why the hell not. Please be aware that this mod is basically a reskin to the game; there are no new units, upgrades, maps, or anything else of the sort. This is simply a mod that modifies the maps and lighting slightly to make it all a little more eerie, while also having the Flood tracks playing on all Skirmish maps for that added touch. The campaign has also gotten the same lighting treatment, but the music is untouched to not interfere with mission scripts that may or may not override music.</description>
